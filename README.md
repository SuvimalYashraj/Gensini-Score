# Gensine Score Prediction

A data analytics and prediction module to identify risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in four metabolic groups by calculating the Gensini score indicating severity of CAD.
The patients are divided in four groups on the basis of Metabolic or Phenotypical obesity and the focus is on finding the group which is more prone to CAD. 
In addition, prognostic markers for CAD like HBA1C, FI, HDL, LDL, etc. were found group wise. 
Three different models using R â€“ linear regression, lasso regression and the complex Neural Networks. 

## Conclusion
The prognostic markers were obtained having positive and negative correlations with CAD
