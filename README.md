# Gensine Score Prediction

## Objectives
1. To study the severity of Coronary Artery Disease among these four groups.
a) Metabolically healthy normal weight.
b) Metabolically obese normal weight.
c) Metabolically healthy obese.
d) Metabolically abnormal obese.

2. To compare the association of Insulin resistance & hsCRP with severity of angiographic Coronary artery disease among four groups.

## Overview
A data analytics and prediction module to identify risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in four metabolic groups by calculating the Gensini score indicating severity of CAD.
The patients are divided in four groups on the basis of Metabolic or Phenotypical obesity and the focus is on finding the group which is more prone to CAD. 
In addition, prognostic markers for CAD like HBA1C, FI, HDL, LDL, etc. were found group wise. 
Three different models using R â€“ linear regression, lasso regression and the complex Neural Networks.
